# rust-rag-toolchain

## Overview

`rust-rag-toolchain` is a Rust native library designed to empower developers with seamless access to retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. The library not only facilitates retrieval of information from a vector database but also enables the generation of embeddings.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Allows for better prompt completions based on your own knowledge base.

- **Embedding Generation:** Generate embeddings for a knowledge store, allowing a foundation for doing RAG with your own data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language installed. Visit [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for installation instructions.

### Installation

Not released yet
