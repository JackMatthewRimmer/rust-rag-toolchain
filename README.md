`rust-rag-toolchain` is a Rust native library designed to empower developers with seamless access to common Gen AI workflows.

#### Note that this library is still being iterated on so newer versions are likely to cause some incompatibility with future versions however this will stabilise over time.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Allows for better prompt completions based on your own knowledge base.

- **Embedding Generation:** Generate embeddings for a knowledge store, allowing a foundation for doing RAG with your own data.

- **Embedding Storage:** Stored generated emebedding easily in any vector database we support 

## Getting Started
