# rust-rag-toolchain

## Overview

`rust-rag-toolchain` is a Rust native library designed to empower developers with seamless access to retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. The library not only facilitates retrieval of information from a vector database but also enables the generation of embeddings, allowing users to persist and utilize this 
enriched information efficiently.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Leverage RAG techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of generated content by incorporating information retrieval mechanisms.

- **Embedding Generation:** Generate embeddings for a knowledge store, enabling efficient representation and analysis.

- **Persistence:** Store generated embeddings, providing a foundation for building data-driven applications.
